# Get Next Line Project

## Description

This project involves implementing a function `get_next_line` in C that reads a line from a file descriptor. The function allows reading a file or standard input line by line, processing it efficiently without reading the entire file into memory at once.

## Project Structure

- `get_next_line.c`: Contains the implementation of the `get_next_line` function.
- `get_next_line_utils.c`: Includes helper functions used in `get_next_line.c`.
- `get_next_line.h`: Header file defining the prototype for `get_next_line`.
- `BONUS PART...`:

## Usage

### Compilation

To compile the project with a specified buffer size (example with a buffer size of 42):

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c <additional_files>.c
```
### Function Usage

- `char *get_next_line(int fd)`: Reads a line from the given file descriptor.
  - Parameters:
    - `fd`: File descriptor to read from.
  - Returns:
    - `char *` containing the read line.
    - `NULL` if there is nothing else to read or an error occurs.

### Recommendations

- Follow the project guidelines strictly.
- Efficiently handle memory allocation and deallocation.
- Implement error checks for file reading and function calls.
- Optimize for different `BUFFER_SIZE` values to ensure scalability.
- Test the function extensively with various input scenarios.
- Document your code for clarity and understanding.

## SOME BASICS

## File Descriptor Basics

In C, file descriptors represent open files or I/O resources:
- `0 (stdin)`: Standard input (keyboard).
- `1 (stdout)`: Standard output (console).
- `2 (stderr)`: Standard error (error messages to console).
- Functions like `open()`, `read()`, and `close()` utilize file descriptors for file operations.

## File Operations

### Opening Files

- `open()` function: Opens files and assigns a file descriptor. Flags control access modes (e.g., read-only, write-only).
  
### Reading from Files

- `read()` function: Reads data from a file into a buffer using the file descriptor.

### Writing to Files

- `write()` function: Writes data from a buffer to a file via the file descriptor.

### Closing Files

- `close()` function: Closes the file associated with the file descriptor.

## Buffer Management

Buffer management involves handling memory efficiently with temporary data storage:
- A buffer is a memory chunk used for temporary data storage.
- Buffer size determines read/write efficiency and memory usage.
- Strategies like reading line by line and reusing buffers optimize memory usage.
- In `get_next_line`, buffers are allocated, data is read into them, and lines are processed without loading the entire file into memory.

## Notes

- Avoid using global variables and the `lseek()` function as per project guidelines.
- Implement logical handling for reading from files and standard input efficiently.
- Test your code extensively with different input scenarios.
